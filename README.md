# golb

A blog, but we're going backwards!

- Self-hostable
- Single binary
- Markdown content
- Managed via the command line
- RSS feed

## What?

There are a lot of really awesome, fully-featured blog platforms
out there, many of which enable creators to distribute content
and monetize it really easily, but because I can and want to, I
decided to write my own (yet another) blog engine that's as simple
and dumb as possible.

Golb is a SQLite-using, Markdown-rendering, RSS-providing blog engine
written in Go and managed via a TUI that allows users to write content
and then post it, and that's about it.
